A sailing club operates dinghy races for club-owned boats and boats owned by its members or visitors. Dinghies have a boat name, a class name and a sail number. Club boats must be sailed by a club member, identified by their member ID. Other boats (known as 'own boats') can be sailed by members or visitors. A race organiser keeps a list of the dinghies racing.

To start this project:
	      1- Create a new RaceOrganiser object.
	      2- Create new ClubBoat or OwnBoat objects.
	      3- Use the created RaceOrganiser object to add, clear, get racers size and print raisers.
	         a- Using its addRacer method to add the boats created to the racing.
	         b- Using its clear method to clear the list of the dinghies racing.
	         c- Using its getRacersSize to get the size of the racing.
	         d- Using its printRacers to display a table containing details of the dinghies in the race.
